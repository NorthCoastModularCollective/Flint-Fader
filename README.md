Sometimes you just want a fader. Nothing fancy, just up and down voltage. This little workhorse does just that: provides voltages from between 0v to +5v in a slim 2hp package. Want 4 faders in a row? Just stack 4 Flint Faders next to each other. Want to have the output jack on the top instead of the bottom? Just flip the front panel and then change the voltage direction switch on the back side of the module. Want the voltage to go from +5v to 0v? Just flip the voltage direction switch on the back of the module. This module pairs very well with other modules that have CV inputs with no interface controls, like the wonderful Disting or Ornament and Crime modules.
